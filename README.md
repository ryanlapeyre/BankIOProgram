# BankIOProgram
A program made when I was a sophomore and beginning to learn how to code. Amateurish and unnecessarily long, but it helped me learn.
To run, compile with gcc filename.c
In order to run, execute with the line (after compiling) ./a.out input.txt 7 output.txt
The 7 is for the amount of accounts in the file. Feel free to add to the input.txt and adjust the number when running! The input and output files are for reading and writing, respectively.
